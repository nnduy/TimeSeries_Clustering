# TimeSeries_Clustering
INTRODUCTION

The main goal of this research is mining meaningful phenomena by dividing data points into a number of groups based on their similarities, and simultaneously, separate them based on their dissimilarities. Such kind of data origin from economics, astronomy, weather in which we measure the level of a certain phenomenon once a month or once a week. We will be discussing the group mechanism known as clustering. Without prior awarded the number of clusters, we use diï¬€erent types of clustering methods and techniques to distinguish groups in the population of data.

Clustering techniques are diverse and can be categorized in types: hard versus fuzzy cluster-ing, in algorithm models: connectivity, centroid, distribution, and density. Some isolate various density regions and assign the data points within these regions, or derived for similarity by the closeness of a data point to the centroid of the clusters. These are known as density models and K-means clustering respectively. We will take a closer look at DBSCAN and OPTICS of density-based clustering with its abilities to model multiple covariance structures and test each.

Clustering discovery is not the only main investigation of this research, but also missing data imputation research methods. Based on many reference literature, where we can conclude various results for the investigation. We take a glimpse of multiple tests that can help us reveal insight structures of examined data.
